# Julia Experiments
A small collection of Julia experiments I created while learning Julia. Please take that into consideration while reviewing the code, I am open to any optimizations as long as they don't obliterate the code.

## Finished experiments
### zeckendorf.jl
A small piece of code implementing the [Zeckendorf-theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem).
